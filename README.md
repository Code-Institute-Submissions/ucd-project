# User Centric Design Project

Welcome to my first design project for the web development course with 
Code Institute.

## The Monkees Webpage

The Monkees webpage has been designed to provide fans, new and old alike,
with a resource to learn about the band's origins, listen to songs and watch 
the band's videos. Links are provided to further social media content regarding
songs and videos. The webpage, also, provides the opportunity to contact the band
through a variety of means.

### Common Features

#### The Header

The page header is written using the Bootstrap framework to provide responsive images
to capture the band and their logo. Additional CSS styling is used to centre the content
within each column.

#### Navigation

The navigation bar is written with Bootstrap using Javascript and jQuery plug-ins to 
create the collapsible menu for mobile device screens. Further Bootstrap Javascript
is used to make the navigation bar remain at the top of the screen, to provide easy 
menu access when scrolling through the page. Additional CSS styling is used to adjust
size and colour.

#### The Footer

The page footer is written using the Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive image
and soial media contact links. Additional CSS styling is used to centre content and to
provide style and transition features to the social media links.

incorporates images of the band themselves and on-stage. The home page is written in HTML
with CSS styling to position images within the text.

The content of the audio page provides fans with access to 4 songs and a link to further
social media content. The audio page is written using the Bootstrap framework to provide a
responsive layout for the songs on different size devices. Additional CSS styling is used
to centre content and ,also, implements flexbox design to wrap the song thumbnail images
and controls as the screen size changes. 

### The Video Page

The content of the video page provides fans with access to one of the band's videos and a
link to further videos through social media. The video page is written in HTML with CSS 
styling to centre the content.

### The Contact Page

The content of the contact page provides fans with a variety of means to get in touch with
the band and ask any questions and leave any messages if desired. The contact page is written
using the Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive layout for different size devices. The 
contact form uses nested columns within the main Bootstrap framework. Additional CSS styling
is used to centre content.
