# User Centric Design Project

Welcome to my first design project for the web development course with 
Code Institute.

## The Monkees Webpage

The Monkees webpage has been designed to provide fans, new and old alike,
with a resource to learn about the band's origins, listen to songs and watch 
the band's videos. Links are provided to further social media content regarding
songs and videos. The webpage, also, provides the opportunity to contact the band
through a variety of means.

to capture the band and their logo. Additional CSS styling is used to centre the content
within each column.

and controls as the screen size changes.
